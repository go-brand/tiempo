- This is tiempo, a lightweight utility library for converting between UTC and timezone-aware datetimes using the Temporal API.
- Tech stack: TypeScript, Vitest for testing, tsup for building, published as npm package.
- This library exclusively uses the Temporal API for datetime handling. No Date objects, no date-fns, no moment.js.
- **`src/index.ts`** - Main library exports: `toZonedTime()`, `toUtc()`, and `toUtcString()` functions
- **`src/index.test.ts`** - Vitest test suite for timezone conversion functions
- **`src/temporal.d.ts`** - TypeScript type declarations for Temporal API
- **Release process**: Use `pnpm release <patch|minor|major>` to publish new versions. The script runs tests, type checks, builds, bumps version, and pushes to trigger automated npm publishing via GitHub Actions.
- **Minimal API surface**
- **Zero abstractions**: Direct use of Temporal API primitives (Instant, ZonedDateTime)
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper Temporal types
- **Polyfill included**: Uses `@js-temporal/polyfill` for browser compatibility
- **Rob Pike's principles**: Always aim for idiomatic code. Simple, clear, direct. No unnecessary complexity or "future-proofing"
- Function signatures should be obvious: take what you need, return what you produce
- No error handling for impossible states: trust the Temporal API primitives
- No configuration objects: parameters are direct and explicit
- Code should read like documentation: the implementation should explain itself
